      The Tangible Media Group, led by
      Professor Hiroshi Ishii, pursues the
      vision of <b>Tangible Bits &amp; Radical Atoms</b> to seamlessly
      couple the dual worlds
      of bits and atoms by giving dynamic
      physical form to digital information
      and computation.<br />
      As the Tangible Media Group approaches its next
      chapter, <br />it revisits its origins in the vision
      of <b>Seamless Telepresence</b> and introduces a new
      vision: <b>TeleAbsence</b>—to connect people across
      time, including one’s younger self, lost loved ones, and even the afterlife.<br />
